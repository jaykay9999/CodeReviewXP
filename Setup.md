# GitRev Game Setup Instructions

Enhance your GitHub experience by installing GitRev, a tool designed to gamify your code reviewing process. Follow these simple steps to get started.

## Step 1: Install GitRev GitHub App

1. Navigate to the [GitRev on GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/gitrev-game).
2. Scroll down to find the 'Install it for free' button and click it.
3. Carefully read the access permissions required for authentication and proceed to authenticate the app. It will only fetch data from your public issues and pull requests in public repositories.

## Step 2: Install GitRev Chrome Extension

1. Go to the [GitRev Chrome Extension page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitrev-game/apkejojcfjnkcbdhghbbglhjnopmadce?utm_source=ext_sidebar&hl=en-US).
2. Click on 'Add to Chrome' to install the GitRev extension.

## Step 3: One-Time Login

1. After installing the Chrome extension, a 'One Time Login' button will become available. Click this button to authenticate through the GitHub OAuth app.
2. Return to GitHub and refresh the page to finalize the setup.

**Note:** Please allow a few minutes for your existing GitHub contributions to be evaluated. You will be assigned a level and points based on the quantity and quality of your past contributions. The 'One Time Login' button is designed to appear only once and will not be displayed again after the initial setup.

Happy coding and enjoy your gamified GitHub experience!
